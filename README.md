# The Short Bible

Just how short would the bible be if you cut out all the names that pop up in between?

---

This project is inspired by The Kangaroo Chronicles, a novel written by Marc-Uwe Kling about a communistic kangaroo.

## Overview

This project is seperated into three different parts, named after books of the old testament.

### Genesis

A web scraper to scrape the entirety of the bible into a JSON / MySQL file.

### Exodus

A Parser to help me find all sorts of "name credit rolls". I'll still be required to read through the entire thing, but I hope that it will help me find a **lot** of credit rolls easier.

The final *short* version will then also be available in JSON and as a MySQL file.

### Leviticus

A web app to read the long and short bible side by side.

#### Planned features:

- Side by side reading
- single bible reading
- comparative progress bar
- A result on just how much shorter the short bible is

## Disclaimer

I am not religious. In fact, I believe that the bible is the best book to turn you into an atheist. This project is just for fun. There isn't much thought behind it, so you shouldn't put too much thought into it, too.
